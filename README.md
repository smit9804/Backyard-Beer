Backyard Beer is the web application people wish they had in college.
Working similar to the functionality of Gas-Buddy, this app allows the user to see what the best prices are at the local gas stations and corner stores.
As well, the user can input what they bought and how much it cost them. 

Functionality includes: filtering by state, town, brand, and size of case.

This application uses **Python** within the **Django** framework. The back end includes authentication via **Regex** and **Bcrypt**.
